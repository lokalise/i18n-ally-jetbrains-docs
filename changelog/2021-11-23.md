**Plugin now supports react-i18next localization package!** ðŸš€ (see [React Source](../jetbrains/source-code/react-jsx-tsx))

#### Features:
 - Add i18next placeholder format
 - Skip default namespace for i18next format: `t('common:key')` could be `{t('key')}`

#### Experience improvements:
 - Remove spaces when extracting from React: `{ t(...) }` became `{t(...)}`
 - Wrap placeholders in single quotes when extracting from React
 - Support JS/TS language files where object with translations is declared first and exported later
 - Extract an enforced React space `({' '})` as a usual space in the language files

#### Plug and play configuration improvements:
 - Introduced automatic configuration for `react-i18next` projects

#### Bugfixes:
 - Ensure that all settings are immediately applied without reopening a project
