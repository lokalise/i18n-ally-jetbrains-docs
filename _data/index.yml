  title: Frequently asked questions
  items:
  - title: How complex is the configuration?
    text: It's automated. Open the project and the plugin will configure everything
      automatically.
  - title: Will it support my custom project?
    text: Yes. The plugin provides flexible manual configuration options.
  - title: Is it possible that the plugin will break my code and I won't see it?
    text: Don’t worry – the plugin will not mess up the changes in git and comes with
      full Undo support.
  - title: I work only on a subset of the project, would the plugin apply to the whole
      project?
    text: The plugin can be pointed to work on only a small subset of your app.
  - title: My colleagues are using VS Code, do you support them?
    text: Yes, but it works a little differently than it does for PhpStorm. <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lokalise.i18n-ally">Check
      the extension out at VS Code Marketplace</a>.
