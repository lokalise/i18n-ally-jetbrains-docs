  items:
    - title: "How complex is the configuration?"
      text: "It's automated. Open the project and the plugin will configure everything automatically."
    - title: "Will it support my custom project?"
      text: "Yes. The plugin provides flexible manual configuration options."
    - title: "Is it possible that the plugin will break my code and I won't see it?"
      text: "Don’t worry – the plugin will not mess up the changes in git and comes with full Undo support."
    - title: "I work only on a subset of the project, would the plugin apply to the whole project?"
      text: "The plugin can be pointed to work on only a small subset of your app."
    - title: "My colleagues are using VS Code, do you support them?"
      text: "Yes, but it works a little differently than it does for PhpStorm. Check the extension out here."
