## Scope

i18n Ally is applying inspections for files that have `.blade.php` extension and are included into
[a PhpStorm's scope](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/settings-scopes.html#d55e18f7).

Create a new scope or adjust existing by clicking on `â€¦` button and handpicking only the meaningful directories and files.

Select `Project files` to include all `.blade.php` files in your project.
