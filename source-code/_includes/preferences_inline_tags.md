## Inline tags

List of tags that would be taken inside translations, like `a`, `strong` or `span`. Filled by default with
[all "inline" tags listed on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements#elements).

An example of extraction result difference between block and inline tags:

{{ include.sample }}

You can add custom tags, like `icon`, by appending a new tag to the comma-separated list.
