# Ignore strings by content

Ignoring a hard-coded string will result in the exact string not being detected as hard-coded for the entire project.

## Usage
Hard-coded strings can be ignored via the context menu and selecting `"Context actions"`
or with hot keys `Alt + Enter` (`Option + Return` in MacOS) and selecting `"i18n Ally: Ignore in this project"`

To undo this action either use the context menu and select `"i18n Ally: Unignore the exact string"` or with hot keys `Ctrl + Z` (`Command + Z` in MacOS).
