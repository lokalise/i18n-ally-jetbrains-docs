## PHP arrays for localization
### Single array definition per file is supported
#### Returning an array is supported
```php
<?php

return [
    'key' => 'Value',
    'another_key' => 'Another value',
    ...
    'extracted' => 'Extracted string will be added like this',
    ...
    'some_key' => [
        'nested_key' => 'Nested keys are also supported',
    ],
    ...
    'multiline' => 'An explicitly multiline strings
        will be extracted like this.'
];
```
#### Array assignment is supported
```php
<?php

$lang = [
    'key' => 'Value',
    'another_key' => 'Another value',
    ...
    'extracted' => 'Extracted string will be added like this',
    ...
    'some_key' => [
        'nested_key' => 'Nested keys are also supported',
    ],

### Unsupported formats
<UnsupportedFormats/>

#### Appending to an array is not supported
```php
<?php

$lang = [];
$lang['key'] = 'Value';
$lang['another_key'] = 'Appending to an array is not supported';
```

#### Only the latest array definition is supported
```php
$first = [
    'key' => 'This array definition will be ignored',
];

$latest = [
    'another_key' => 'Only the latest array definition is supported',
];
```

#### Translations nested after a different key are not supported
Nested translations are `only` supported if they start from the `root`. In the sample below, the translations are after a different key which is not supported.

```php
<?php

return [
    'metadata' => [
        'non_translation_key' => true,
    ],
    'translations' => [
        'key' => 'This is NOT supported, because i18n Ally calls it like `translations.key` while the app would use just `key`',
    ],
];
```

#### Complex structures within a key are not supported
```php
<?php

return [
    'key' => [
        'translation' => 'Complex structure per key is NOT supported',
        'notes' => '',
    ],
];
```
