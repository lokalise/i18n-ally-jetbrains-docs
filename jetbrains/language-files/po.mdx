## PO and POT for localization
### PO file format basics are supported
```json
msgid "key"
msgstr "Value"
...
msgid ""
"Keys spread "
"across multiple lines"
msgstr "Keys which are spread across multiple lines are also supported"
...
msgid "extracted"
msgstr ""
...
msgid "multiline"
msgstr "An explicitly multiline strings\nwill be extracted like this."
```
### POT files would have empty **`msgstr`**
```json
msgid "Extracted string will be added like this"
msgstr ""
...
msgid ""
"Keys spread "
"across multiple lines"
msgstr ""
...
msgid "An explicitly multiline strings\nwill be extracted like this."
msgstr ""
```

### Indentation
No formatting options are available for PO files.

### Unsupported formats
<UnsupportedFormats/>

#### Nested keys are not supported
```json
msgid "some_key.nested_key"
msgstr "Nested keys are not supported by the file format"
```

#### References are not added during extraction nested under some key are not supported
```json
#: public/i18n.php:13
msgid "key"
msgstr "References to source string won't be added during extraction"
```

#### Compilation to MO files is not supported
PO files should be compiled into MO files with other tools, like [GNU **`msgfmt`** utility](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/msgfmt-Invocation.html):

```
msgfmt messages.po -o messages.mo
```
