Translatable attributes are also checked for the translatable text:
```html
<img src="â€¦"
     alt="Checked by default"
     title="Checked by default"
     data-content="Requires configuration" />
```
You can add custom attributes, like `data-content`, by appending a new attribute to the comma-separated list.
