#### `%key%`
<p>{props.keyExtraInfo}</p>
Short key or a natural language string that defines a translation.

#### `%namespace%`
Namespace (called ‘domain’ in Symfony) usually means a part of language file path from where translations would be searched for. <br/>
The default namespace is usually `messages`, but could be changed by putting a namespace in first position in “Namespaces” field.

#### `%map%`
If there are no variables in the string, then nothing would be added.

<p>
    Map will be replaced with an object if there are any placeholders detected:<br/>
    <code>{props.mapTemplate}</code>.
</p>

Placeholder names will be determined automatically based on a respective variable, function or method name.

In language files placeholder syntax will be determined based on the Placeholder format setting of the language file.

#### `%list%`
If there are no variables in the string, then nothing would be added.

<p>
    List will be replaced with an array if there are any placeholders detected:<br/>
    <code>{props.listTemplate}</code>
</p>

In language files the ordered placeholder syntax `{0}, {1}` will be enforced.

#### `%varargs%`
If there are no variables in the string, then nothing would be added.

<p>
    Varargs will be replaced with placeholder passed directly to the translation function if there are any placeholders
    detected:<br/>
    <code>{props.argsTemplate}</code>
</p>

In language files the ordered placeholder syntax `{0}, {1}` will be enforced.
