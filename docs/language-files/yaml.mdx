## YAML for localization
### Key/value is the only supported format
```yaml
key: Value
another_key: 'Another value'
...
extracted: 'Extracted string will be added like this'
extracted_single_word: Extracted
...
some_key:
    nested_key: 'Nested keys are also supported'
...
multiline: |
    'An explicitly multiline strings
    will be extracted like this.'
```

### Indentation
Configure formatting at the IDE level in [Preferences | Editor | Code Style | YAML](phpstorm://settings?name=Editor--Code+Style--YAML).

### Unsupported formats
<UnsupportedFormats/>

#### Arrays are not supported
```yaml
key:
    - 'One value'
    - 'Arrays are NOT supported'
```


#### Translations nested after a different key are not supported
Nested translations are `only` supported if they start from the `root`. In the sample below, the translations are after a different key which is not supported.
```yaml
metadata:
    non_translation_key: true
translations:
    key: 'This is NOT supported, because i18n Ally calls it like `translations.key` while the app would use just `key`'
```

It is still possible to extract strings into complex structures of YAML and examples like the above, but it is `not supported`,
because some frameworks parse language files differently, e.g., [Ruby on Rails i18n API](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html) with the locale as the root key.

#### Complex structures within a key are not supported
```yaml
other_key:
    translation: 'Complex structure per key is NOT supported'
    notes: ''
```
