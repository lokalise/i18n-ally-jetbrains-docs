# Navigation to translation
The plugin supports seamless navigation from the source code key to the sink file and back, 
by interacting with the translation key name. Once the action is performed the source/sink file is opened in the editor.

## Usage
Navigate to the language file via holding `Ctrl` (hold `Cmd` on MacOS) 
and left-click on the key or use `Ctrl + B` (`Cmd + B`) hotkey while hovering the cursor over the key.
