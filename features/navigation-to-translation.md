<h1>Navigation to translation</h1>

The plugin supports seamless navigation from the source code key to the sink file and back, by interacting with the 
translation key name. Once the action is performed the source/sink file is opened in the editor.

## Usage

Navigate to the language file via holding `Ctrl` (hold `Cmd` on MacOS) and left-click on the key
or use `Ctrl + B` (`Cmd + B)` hotkey while hovering the cursor over the key.
