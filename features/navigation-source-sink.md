# Navigation from/to sink

The plugin supports seamless navigation from the source code key to the sink file and back, by interacting with the 
translation key name. Once the action is performed the source/sink file is opened in the editor.

**Note**, in order for this to work, sink, source and scope configuration needs to be correctly set up.

## Usage

Navigate to the language file via holding `Ctrl` (hold `Cmd` on MacOS) and left-click on the key
or use `Ctrl + B` (`Cmd + B)` hotkey while hovering the cursor over the key.
